<h1>Privacy Policy – VoiceCal</h1>

<ul>

analytics, profiling, or any secondary purposes.</p>

<h2>3. Data Storage</h2>

Data is processed only as necessary to complete the requested action.
Calendar operations occur directly between your browser and Google’s secure APIs.</p>

<h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
